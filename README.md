### Hi, I'm Francesco 👋
 - Freelancer.
 - Full Stack Developer and Project Manager.
 - Truly Passionate About How Things Work.

I always like to find a better way to make the offline world interact with the online world, especially when it is complex and in real-time.
Facing the limits is a challenge that I set for myself every day, exceeding them is more rewarding than mere monetary compensation.

In my spare time, I contribute to the world of open source and mentor others to use best practices and avoid mistakes, I actively follow and contribute to [Agile Toolkit](https://github.com/atk4) a really exciting Low-code Framework for Web Apps in PHP.
