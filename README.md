### Hi, i'm Francesco 👋
 - Freelance.
 - Full Stack Developer and Project Manager.
 - Truly Passionate About How Things Work.

I write code, mainly PHP.
The world is full of labels so I call myself Full Stack Developer and Project Manager.
I always like to find a better way to make the offline world interact with the online world, especially when is complex and in real time.
Facing the limits is a challenge that I set myself every day, exceeding them is more rewarding than mere monetary compensation.

In my spare time, i contribute to the world of open source and mentor others to use best practices and avoid mistakes, i actively follow and contribute to [Agile Toolkit](https://github.com/atk4) a really exiting Low-code Framework for Web Apps in PHP.
